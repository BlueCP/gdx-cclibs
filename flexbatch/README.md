# FlexBatch
FlexBatch is a library for LibGDX used for batching many small custom objects. It can be used as a flexible version of SpriteBatch, but where the sprites can have custom parameters, multi-texturing, bump-mapped lighting, etc. It can also be used for small objects in 3D (for example, a flexible version of DecalBatch).
